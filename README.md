# Project-Diva-Parkour

The purpose of the game is to collect the currency 'karma' from the games, and use it to unlock more modes of the game
Different game mode means different difficulty and different background music (because of time, I cannot make unique art for each of them)
You can create your own account and your data will be stored (please don't enter your frequent used password as the profile files are not encrypted)
Run game.py for the main program. If you wish to initialize the program (clear data), please run initialization.
Have fun!

There is an account precreated for you which has the amount of karma enough to unlock everything
